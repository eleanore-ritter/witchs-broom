This directory contains the Witch's Broom project. :grapes:

**Project goal:** I am trying to uncover the potential genetic basis for the Witch's Broom (WB) budsport in grapevine using whole genome sequencing data.

The directory is structured with the following subdirectories as such:

* bin : contains compiled files, such as installed programs
* data: contains the paired end read files from sequencing, with all four samples (Dakopa WT, Dakopa WB, Merlot WT, and Merlot WB)
* refs: contains the files for the reference genomes used
* results: contains the resulting output files from scripts run, as well as the notebook for the project
* scripts: contains the scripts for the project
